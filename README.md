# Vulnerability-Calculator
Application for graph's vulnerability calculation.
# About
Vulnerability calculator is an open source software which's goal is to calculate a network's vulnerability index based on the graph's efficiency.

# Introduction
In order to calculate the Vulnerability index <b>V<sub>k</sub></b> , first, you calculate the network's efficiency <b>E</b> and, in an orderly fashion, remove nodes from it then recalculate the efficiency <b>E<sub>k</sub></b> without this node. Done this you, compare the old efficiency with the new one with the following equation: <b>V<sub>k</sub></b> = ( <b>E</b> - <b>E<sub>k</sub></b>) / <b>E</b>

# Requirements
1. Python 3.0+ and Igraph library.

# How to execute
1. Create an input file(.txt) that contains the vertices adjacencies. Each row must contain a pair of vertices.
Consider the example of the input file formatting for a order=6 graph, where vertices 0 and 1 are adjacents, just like vertices 2 and 3:

   a,b      
   c,d
   e,f

2. Run Vuln_calculator.py
