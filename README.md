# Vulnerability-Calculator
Application for graph's vulnerability calculation.
# About
Vulnerability calculation is an open source software which's goal is to calculate a network's vulnerability based on two different models.

1. Traditional vulnerability index: Calculation based on how the graph's efficiency react to the removal of an element.
2. Isolation index: Calculation based on how many vertices will become inaccessible with the removal of a certain vertex.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.0+ and Igraph library.

# How to execute
1. Create an input file(.txt) that contains the vertices adjacencies. Each row must contain a pair of vertices, and they must be represented by integers.
Consider the example of the input file formatting for a order=4 graph, where vertices 0 and 1 are adjacents, just like vertices 2 and 3:

   0,1      
   2,3

2. Run Vuln_calculator.py
